/* A few notes on how the processing is organized:

I found that the processing is bizarrely, shockingly slow if I attempt
to do it all in one query, but much faster if I split the processing
into multiple queries. To keep that speed in a single query I used
common table expressions (CTEs), which serve as optimization fences so
that postgres optimizes each query section separately.

I also split the processing by data source so that a new data file
does not require reprocessing all data. Therefore there are separate
materialized views for each source. */
