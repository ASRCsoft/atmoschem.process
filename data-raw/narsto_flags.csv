V0,Valid value,Flag valid data values.,Applies to all measurement data types.
V1,Valid value but comprised wholly or partially of below-MDL data,"Applies to both single and averaged data values. Measured value reported, even when below MDL. Define MDL (minimum detectable limit).",Applies to all measurement data types. See related V7 flag.
V2,Valid estimated value,"Can apply to calculated values, approximate/out-of-range values, and measured values with, for example, EPA ""J"" flag (see footnote).","Applies to all measurement data types, model input and output data products, and gridded data products."
V3,Valid interpolated value,Valid interpolated value. Provide interpolation method in documentation.,"Applies to all measurement data types, model input and output data products, and gridded data products."
V4,Valid value despite failing to meet some QC or statistical criteria,Apply this flag based on evaluation of field and laboratory QC sample data and subsequent statistical outlier tests on the entire data set.,Applies to all measurement data types.
V5,Valid value but qualified because of possible contamination,Apply this flag for possible contamination of blanks and regular samples.,Applies to all measurement data types.
V6,Valid value but qualified due to non-standard sampling conditions,Provide description of sampling conditions or variance from SOP in documentation.,Applies to all measurement data types.
V7,Valid value but set equal to the detection limit (DL) because the measured value was below the DL,Applies to both single and averaged data values. The measurement was below DL and the Principal Investigator lacks confidence in it and the DL was substituted in its place. Define MDL (minimum detectable limit).,Applies to all measurement data types. See related V1 flag.
M1,Missing value because no value is available,Use this flag when no result was reported. Identify in documentation the missing value code that is used in the result field.,Applies to all measurement data types.
M2,Missing value because invalidated by Data Originator,Use this flag when the result reported to a site database was invalid. Invalid results are not sent to the NARSTO archive. Identify in documentation the missing value code that is used in the result field.,Applies to all measurement data types.
H1,Historical data that have not been assessed or validated,"Use this flag when, for example, historical data may have been used for preliminary characterization or range finding purposes. It will not be used in subsequent analyses but is part of the project record.","Applies to all measurement data types, model input and output data products, and gridded data products."
