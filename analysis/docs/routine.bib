	abstract = {ABSTRACTLong-term records of condensed-phase chemical data are presented from the Adirondack Mountain region of northern New York, USA. These data records are particularly valuable due to the combinations of aerosol, cloud, and precipitation measurements. Objectives of the research and this overview paper include the evaluation of emission reductions of regulated air pollutants and the observed effects on measured deposition, as well as the implications of changing pollutant concentration levels on human health and climate. Summer season cloud chemistry and year-round wet deposition and particulate matter data from two stations on Whiteface Mountain are presented to highlight some of the research and monitoring activities at this mountain location. Clear decreases in the anion concentrations and increases in pH over the past two decades have been observed in cloud and precipitation results. Large decreases in aerosol sulfate ({\textgreater} 80\%) and aerosol optical black carbon ({\textgreater} 60\%) have been observed for these species over the nearly 40 year summit observatory data record for these measurements, and decreases in PM2.5 mass, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium have also been recorded over the shorter 15 year period of measurement at the Marble Mountain Lodge level. The studies cited here highlight some of the past successes of air pollution regulation under the Clean Air Act and Amendments and pave the way for future progress in reducing air pollution.},

	abstract = {A research site for atmospheric chemistry and air pollution measurements was established at Pinnacle State Park in Addison, NY, in 1995. This paper presents an overview of the site characteristics and measurement program, as well as monthly average concentrations for many of the trace gas and aerosol pollutants over the full measurement period. Monthly averaged ozone concentrations range from values as low as 15 parts per billion (ppb) during cold-season months, to values approaching 50 ppb during some spring and summer months. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and reactive odd nitrogen (NOy) all show distinct seasonal variation, with summertime monthly averages as low as 1–3 ppb, and wintertime monthly averages from 6–12 ppb. The variation in carbon monoxide (CO) is much smaller, with minimums of approximately 150 ppb and maximums only rarely exceeding 250 ppb. Data for three hydrocarbon species propane, benzene, and isoprene—are presented. Propane and benzene show higher monthly averaged concentrations in the winter and lower values in the summer, with values ranging over a factor of 4–5. Isoprene, on the other hand has much higher values during the summer season, sometimes a factor of 10 or more greater than concentrations measured in the winter. Monthly averaged plots for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) beginning in 1999 show a robust summer maximum and winter minimum, and roughly a factor of two difference between the two. An empirical measure of ozone production using the correlation of hour-averaged ozone and NOy data illustrates relatively robust ozone production during some, but not all, summertime months over the time period. Also, an analysis of the frequency distribution of the hours of maximum ozone concentration shows a strong mid-afternoon peak, as expected, but also a prominent secondary maximum centered around midnight. The secondary peak is interpreted as ozone transported from ozone-producing areas to the west, including Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and the Ohio Valley. Finally, SO2 concentrations as a function of wind direction clearly indicate maximum impacts when the winds are out of the south (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia), with a secondary peak when the winds are from the north-northeast, consistent with the locations of major SO2 emission sources in the region.},

The primary goal of the NYSM is to provide high-quality weather data at high spatial and temporal scales to improve atmospheric monitoring and prediction, especially for extreme weather events. As compared with other statewide networks, the NYSM faced considerable deployment obstacles with New York’s complex terrain, forests, and very rural and urban areas; its wide range of weather extremes; and its harsh winter conditions. To overcome these challenges, the NYSM adopted a number of innovations unique among statewide monitoring systems, including 1) strict adherence to international siting standards and metadata documentation; 2) a hardened system design to facilitate continued operations during extreme, high-impact weather; 3) a station design optimized to monitor winter weather conditions; and 4) a camera installed at every site to aid situational awareness. The network was completed in spring of 2018 and provides data and products to a variety of sectors including weather monitoring and forecasting, emergency management, agriculture, transportation, utilities, and education. This paper focuses on the standard network of the NYSM and reviews the network siting, site configuration, sensors, site communications and power, network operations and maintenance, data quality control, and dissemination. A few example analyses are shown that highlight the benefits of the NYSM.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
